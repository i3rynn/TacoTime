# Taco Time
A Taco Testing Application utilizing Node.js/Express/MySQL/Handlebars/Materialize

## Description

This application shows a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and the Materialize framework and the backend used with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the addition of Handlebars.

The user may enter their own unique taco name to add it to the menu. This also adds the new taco entry into the database. The taco entry is added as *available* on the menu and added to the left side of the screen. The user may then choose to eat a taco by clicking on it, which moves it into the opposite and updates its status in the database.

## Demo
